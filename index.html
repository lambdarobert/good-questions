      <h1>How to get your questions answered faster.</h1>
      <p>
        This is a list of tips on how to get questions answered more quickly in
        online spaces. It's tailored toward technical questions in asynchronous
        media such as emails, chat rooms, and forums.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want an overarching theme to remember, the rule of thumb is to
        <em>give the person answering as much help as possible</em>, so they'll
        be incentivized to look at your question sooner. Help them so they can
        help you&mdash; it's a win-win!
      </p>

      <h2>Cast as wide a net as possible</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">Any JavaScript pros around that can help me?</div>
        <div class="good">
          I am trying to do <span class="placeholder">X</span> with JavaScript,
          can someone help?
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you're asking for help, try to avoid walling off people&mdash; leave
        your question open so that anyone feels like they're allowed to answer
        it. This is important for programming in particular because what might
        <em>seem</em> like a language-specific question might actually be
        something that any experienced programmer would know, regardless of
        language. By asking for a "JavaScript pro," you might be walling off a
        Python pro who knows the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a similar note, avoid DMing someone a question when you can just as
        easily reach them in a public place (e.g. a group chat or forum) that
        they frequently visit. That way, not only can they answer, but someone
        else could as well.
      </p>

      <h2>Be Upfront&mdash; Minimize Back-and-Forth</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">Hey, I need some help with JavaScript.</div>
        <div class="good">
          I am trying to do <span class="placeholder">X</span>,
          <span class="placeholder">Y</span>, and
          <span class="placeholder">Z</span> with JavaScript. Here's what I've
          tried so far and here's why it failed:
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <em>Add as much information as you can to your initial post</em> when
        you ask a question. This will make it easier to answer because the
        answerer won't have to ask as many clarifying questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, when communicating over an asynchronous medium, people
        prefer answering questions on their own time over carving out a
        specific, contiguous block of time to help someone. Furthermore, a lot
        of the time, they'll only have a minute or two to answer questions
        before they return to some other task. They won't want to respond to a
        question with a lot of back-and-forth because they might not know when
        they'll next have a break where they can follow up. They don't want to
        leave you hanging!
      </p>

      <h3>"No Hello"</h3>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">Hi!</div>
        <div class="good">
          Hi! I ran into this problem with
          <span class="placeholder">X</span> the other day and needed some help
          with...
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Another tempting mistake is to start with a greeting like "Hi!" or
        "Hello!" This can key people into the fact that someone's online and may
        need help, but if you then spend several minutes writing a longer
        response while others' attention is on you, they might lose interest and
        go back to what they were doing before. On the other hand, if you
        include the problem you want solved in your initial message, they'll see
        it immediately and might help.
      </p>

      <h2>State Your Problem, Not Just Your Solution</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">How do I do <span class="placeholder">X</span>?</div>
        <div class="good">
          How do I do <span class="placeholder">X</span>? I'm trying to use it
          to solve <span class="placeholder">PROBLEM</span>.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This is a restatement of the infamous "XY Problem"&mdash; the case where
        someone is trying to get help using
        <span class="placeholder">X</span> to solve their problem, when in
        reality the solution to their problem is
        <span class="placeholder">Y</span>. If you ask about your problem (and
        not just the way you intend to solve it), others can provide feedback on
        possible alternative solutions that could work better or be easier to
        implement, saving you lots of time and effort.
      </p>

      <h2>Ask <em>Where</em> to find Things</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">How do I do <span class="placeholder">X</span>?</div>
        <div class="good">
          Can you send me some articles about how to do
          <span class="placeholder">X</span>?
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        You'll probably get a faster answer to your questions if you ask about
        <em>where</em> you can find an answer rather than for an answer
        directly&mdash; From an answerer's POV, making a personalized response
        to a question is a lot harder than just sending a link or two.
      </p>

      <h2>Stay in the Asynchronous Communication Channel (if possible)</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">
          I need help with <span class="placeholder">X</span>! Can someone join
          a voice call with me?
        </div>
        <div class="good">
          I need help with <span class="placeholder">X</span>! Fine if you
          respond here.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you are asking for help in an asynchronous medium, (one where people
        don't necessarily have to communicate in real time&mdash; e.g. email, a
        chat room, forums) then it's best to keep communication asynchronous.
        Trying to move communication to a synchronous, real-time medium (e.g. a
        voice/video call) will likely be a turn-off for potential answerers
        because it means they have to carve out a block of time where they are
        dedicated on answering your question. On the other hand, in an
        asynchronous medium, they are free to reply whenever they have spare
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't to say that synchronous communication is bad, however&mdash;
        many will still be willing to join a voice or video call. The main issue
        is that <em>fewer</em> people willl.
      </p>

      <h2>Not Everyone Knows What You Don't Know</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">
          I already know <span class="placeholder">X</span>!
        </div>
        <div class="good">
          The part I'm more confused about is
          <span class="placeholder">Y</span>.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Remember that the people helping you likely won't know what aspects of
        the problem you're familiar with&mdash; and those you aren't familiar
        with. Thus, you'll often run into cases where you're told things you
        already know. While it might seem tempting to get defensive, remember
        that the person helping you isn't doing this to talk down to you&mdash;
        they just don't know what you already know. The most diplomatic way to
        handle a situation like this is to
        <em>redirect the conversation to what you don't know.</em>
