      <h1>How to get your questions answered faster.</h1>
      <p>
        This is a list of tips on how to get questions answered more quickly in
        online spaces. It's tailored toward technical questions in asynchronous
        media such as emails, chat rooms, and forums.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want an overarching theme to remember, the rule of thumb is to
        <em>give the person answering as little needless work as possible</em>,
        so they'll be incentivized to look at your question sooner. This is a
        win-win for both of you&mdash; you get an answer faster; they can answer
        it more easily.

      <h2>Be Upfront&mdash; Minimize Back-and-Forth</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">
          Hey, any JavaScript pros around that could help me?
        </div>
        <div class="good">
          I am trying to do <span class="placeholder">X</span>,
          <span class="placeholder">Y</span>, and
          <span class="placeholder">Z</span> with JavaScript. Here's what I've
          tried so far and here's why it failed:
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <em>Add as much information as you can to your initial post</em> when
        you ask a question. This will make it easier to answer because the
        answerer won't have to ask as many clarifying questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, when communicating over an asynchronous medium, people
        prefer answering questions on their own time over carving out a specific
        block of time to help someone. As a result, they'll try to avoid
        questions that involve a lot of back-and-forth.
      </p>

      <h3>"No Hello"</h3>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">Hi!</div>
        <div class="good">
          Hi! I ran into this problem with
          <span class="placeholder">X</span> the other day and needed some help
          with...
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Another tempting mistake is to start with a greeting like "Hi!" or
        "Hello!" This can key people into the fact that someone's online and may
        need help, but if you then spend several minutes writing a longer
        response while others' attention is on you, they might lose interest and
        go back to what they were doing before. On the other hand, if you
        include the problem you want solved in your initial message, they'll see
        it immediately and might help.
      </p>

      <h2>State Your Problem, Not Just Your Solution</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">How do I do <span class="placeholder">X</span>?</div>
        <div class="good">
          How do I do <span class="placeholder">X</span>? I'm trying to use it
          to solve <span class="placeholder">PROBLEM</span>.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This is a restatement of the infamous "XY Problem"&mdash; the case where
        someone is trying to get help using
        <span class="placeholder">X</span> to solve their problem, when in
        reality the solution to their problem is
        <span class="placeholder">Y</span>. If you ask about your problem (and
        not just the way you intend to solve it), others can provide feedback on
        possible alternative solutions that could work better or be easier to
        implement, saving you lots of time and effort.
      </p>

      <h2>Ask <em>Where</em> to find Things</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">How do I do <span class="placeholder">X</span>?</div>
        <div class="good">
          Can you send me some articles about how to do
          <span class="placeholder">X</span>?
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        You'll probably get a faster answer to your questions if you ask about
        <em>where</em> you can find an answer rather than for an answer
        directly&mdash; From an answerer's POV, making a personalized response
        to a question is a lot harder than just sending a link or two.
      </p>

      <h2>Ask for Asynchronous Communication (if possible)</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">
          I need help with <span class="placeholder">X</span>! Can someone join
          a voice call with me?
        </div>
        <div class="good">
          I need help with <span class="placeholder">X</span>! Fine if you
          respond here.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        If you are asking for help in an asynchronous medium, (one where people
        don't necessarily have to communicate in real time&mdash; e.g. email, a
        chat room, forums) then it's best to keep communication asynchronous.
        Trying to move communication to a synchronous, real-time medium (e.g. a
        voice/video call) will likely be a turn-off for potential answerers
        because it means they have to carve out a block of time where they are
        dedicated on answering your question. On the other hand, in an
        asynchronous medium, they are free to reply whenever they have spare
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't to say that synchronous communication is bad, however&mdash;
        many will still be willing to join a voice or video call. The main issue
        is that <em>fewer</em> people willl.
      </p>

      <h2>Not Everyone Knows What You Don't Know</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">
          I already know <span class="placeholder">X</span>!
        </div>
        <div class="good">
          The part I'm more confused about is
          <span class="placeholder">Y</span>.
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Remember that the people helping you likely won't know what aspects of
        the problem you're familiar with&mdash; and those you aren't familiar
        with. Thus, you'll often run into cases where you're told things you
        already know. While it might seem tempting to get defensive, remember
        that the person helping you isn't doing this to talk down to you&mdash;
        they just don't know what you already know. The most diplomatic way to
        handle a situation like this is to
        <em>redirect the conversation to what you don't know.</em>
