        <p>
          This is a list of tips on how to get questions answered more quickly
          in online spaces. It's tailored toward technical questions in
          asynchronous media such as emails, chat rooms, and forums.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want an overarching theme to remember, the rule of thumb is to
          <em>give the person answering as much help as possible</em>, so
          they'll be incentivized to look at your question sooner. Help them so
          they can help you&mdash; it's a win-win!
        </p>

        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">Any JavaScript pros around that can help me?</div>
          <div class="good">
            I am trying to do <span class="placeholder">X</span> with
            JavaScript, can someone help?
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you're asking for help, try to avoid walling off people&mdash;
          leave your question open so that anyone feels like they're allowed to
          answer it. This is important for programming in particular because
          what might
          <em>seem</em> like a language-specific question might actually be
          something that any experienced programmer would know, regardless of
          language. By asking for a "JavaScript pro," you might be walling off a
          Python pro who knows the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a similar note, avoid DMing someone a question when you can just as
          easily reach them in a public place (e.g. a group chat or forum) that
          they frequently visit. That way, not only can they answer, but someone
          else could as well.

          <div class="bad">Hey, I need some help with JavaScript.</div>
          <div class="good">
            I am trying to do <span class="placeholder">X</span>,
            <span class="placeholder">Y</span>, and
            <span class="placeholder">Z</span> with JavaScript. Here's what I've
            tried so far and here's why it failed:
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          <em>Add as much information as you can to your initial post</em> when
          you ask a question. This will make it easier to answer because the
          answerer won't have to ask as many clarifying questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In general, when communicating over an asynchronous medium, people
          prefer answering questions on their own time over carving out a
          specific, contiguous block of time to help someone. Furthermore, a lot
          of the time, they'll only have a minute or two to answer questions
          before they return to some other task. They won't want to respond to a
          question with a lot of back-and-forth because they might not know when
          they'll next have a break where they can follow up. They don't want to
          leave you hanging!

        <h3 id="no-hello">"No Hello"</h3>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">Hi!</div>
          <div class="good">
            Hi! I ran into this problem with
            <span class="placeholder">X</span> the other day and needed some
            help with...
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Another tempting mistake is to start with a greeting like "Hi!" or
          "Hello!" This can key people into the fact that someone's online and
          may need help, but if you then spend several minutes writing a longer
          response while others' attention is on you, they might lose interest
          and go back to what they were doing before. On the other hand, if you
          include the problem you want solved in your initial message, they'll
          see it immediately and might help.
          <br />
          <br />
          In this sense, you should think of your messages as if you were
          <strong
            >writing a letter to a pen pal, and not a live phone call</strong
          >. You don't need to need to wait for the other person to come online,
          so just ask away! Formality matters less when you are asking for help,
          because the goal is to get <em>you</em> what you need as soon as
          possible. In the same way as if you were writing a pen pal, you
          wouldn't check to see if they are looking at their mailbox before
          sending them a letter. On the internet, if there's nobody online,
          someone will check their messages as soon they are available and get
          back to you. You also wouldn't send a pen pal a blank letter that just
          says "Hello", since they wouldn't know what you want to tell them.

        <h2 id="xy-problem">State Your Problem, Not Just Your Solution</h2>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">How do I do <span class="placeholder">Y</span>?</div>
          <div class="good">
            How do I do <span class="placeholder">Y</span>? I'm trying to use it

        <p>
          If you have a problem and only ask about the way you intend to solve
          it, you lose the opportunity for others to suggest other, potentially
          better solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phenomenon is also know as the "XY Problem"&mdash; the phenomenon
          where someone wants to do <span class="placeholder">X</span> but
          (incorrectly) thinks they can solve it by doing
          <span class="placeholder">Y</span>.

        <h2 id="stay-async">
          Stay in the Asynchronous Communication Channel (if possible)
        </h2>
        <div class="comparison">
          <div class="bad">
            I need help with <span class="placeholder">X</span>! Can someone
            join a voice call with me?
          </div>
          <div class="good">
            I need help with <span class="placeholder">X</span>! Voice call if
            possible but it's fine if you answer here.
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          If you are asking for help in an asynchronous medium, (one where
          people don't necessarily have to communicate in real time&mdash; e.g.
          email, a chat room, forums) then it's best to keep communication
          asynchronous. Trying to move communication to a synchronous, real-time
          medium (e.g. a voice/video call) will likely be a turn-off for
          potential answerers because it means they have to carve out a block of
          time where they are dedicated on answering your question. On the other
          hand, in an asynchronous medium, they are free to reply whenever they
          have spare time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn't to say that synchronous communication is bad, nor is it bad
          to ask if you need synchronous communication to learn. Whether an
          answerer wants to join a voice call is their choice. The main issue is
          that <em>fewer</em> people will be willing to help you.

        <p>
          Remember that the people helping you likely won't know what aspects of
          the problem you're familiar with&mdash; and those you aren't familiar
          with. Thus, you'll often run into cases where you're told things you
          already know. While it might seem tempting to get defensive, remember
          that the person helping you isn't doing this to talk down to
          you&mdash; they just don't know what you already know, and would
          rather not confuse you (and thus waste your time) talking about things
          you would not yet understand. The best way to handle a situation like
          this is to
          <em>redirect the conversation to what you don't know.</em>

          <div class="bad">How do I do <span class="placeholder">X</span>?</div>
          <div class="good">
            How do I do <span class="placeholder">X</span>? I'm making it for

        </div>
        <p>
          In some cases, if you're getting help with a project, you might feel
          tempted to be secretive about it, perhaps to keep it as a surprise or
          to prevent others from taking your ideas. However, being secretive is
          also a big hindrance to fixing your project's issues you because it
          may result in <a href="#xy-problem">XY Problems</a>: By not revealing
          the underlying end goal of your project, you're not giving others the
          opportunity to present better ways of achieving it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being secretive also makes helping more difficult because in a
          secretive project, helpers are likely to lack crucial information,
          preventing them from making informed decisions.

        <p>
          In the end, remember that, unless they're getting paid to help you,
          the people helping you are ultimately volunteering their own time to
          do so, and thus are under no obligation to keep helping you. Don't let
          this stop you from seeking help, however&mdash; because they're
          volunteering, they almost certainly <em>want</em> to help you either
          way, even if they are not required to.

        <p>
          If you get a "bad" question, don't approach the situation assuming
          that the person asking is doing so out of malicious intent&mdash; they
          are much more likely breaking social rules because they do not
          <em>know</em> them. Consider how many of the rules above are actively
          <em>harmful</em> when applied to <em>in-person</em> interactions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#cast-a-wide-net">"Asking to ask"</a> becomes necessary
            because IRL, talking to someone takes their full attention and can't
            be delayed, so it's polite to ask first. Conversely, an online,
            text-based question does not demand your attention and can be read
            later, at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#no-hello">"No hello"</a> becomes bad advice in person
            because greetings establish conversations. If you were busy doing
            something and someone <em>immediately</em> began talking to you,
            you'd likely miss the start of what they said, since you can't
            immediately switch focus. Online, on the other hand, you can take a
            look at someone's question whenever you want.
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#be-upfront">Being upfront</a> becomes a problem because of
            information overload. If someone monologued about their problem to
            you for ten minutes IRL, you wouldn't be able to remember all of
            what they said. On the other hand, online, you don't
            <em>have</em> to remember, because the text will still be there
            after you've read it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In other words, someone breaking these rules is likely doing so
          because they are applying IRL standards to an online forum.

          These sorts of sites are better to link in rules pages, bios, and
          other such public places where many people can see them, as opposed to
          being used as <em>directed, unsolicited advice</em>.

        <p>
          To some, responding to a question with a link to a site like this (or
          DontAskToAsk, No Hello, etc.) can come off as rude, dismissive, and
          accusatory, regardless of the tone of the site itself. It can feel
          like contacting customer service and getting an automated response
          from a bot&mdash; one entirely unrelated to your problem&mdash;
          instead of a real human. Furthermore, depending on the site, responses
          like these can encourage people to get defensive, as they sometimes
          paint people asking questions as being lazy or malicious, even if
          they're acting out of ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of linking a page, try crafting a short response tailored to
          the user's specific problem. If possible, frame it as you trying to
          <em>help them</em> get their question answered. Avoid being
          antagonistic for no reason. If you're concerned about time, keep in
          mind that crafting a response should ideally only take you a few
          seconds.

          It can be tempting to help with something you can't realistically help
          with. After all, the person you offered to help likely now has the
          expectation that you know what you're talking about, and you'd rather
          not let them down. However, giving someone incorrect advice will harm
          them more in the long run than admitting that you don't know
          something.

        <p>
          As much as I like the message behind sites like
          <a href="https://dontasktoask.com/">Don't Ask to Ask</a> and
          <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"
            >Smart Questions</a
          >, (both inspired this site!) I think both of these resources&mdash;
          and many more&mdash; are unnecessarily harsh toward the people who
          make the mistakes they are attempting to rectify. Consider the POV of
          a new user who's clueless about this new activity they're getting help
          with&mdash; they try to ask a question they believe is sufficient,
          only to be told that they're "lazy" and an "idiot." That might not be
          easy for someone who lacks experience (and therefore probably lacks
          confidence) to shrug off. For all you know, this could be their first
          experience so far with the community surrounding whatever they are
          learning, which could be a turn-off entirely. On top of that, if you
          approach situations like these by accusing people of poor etiquette,
          they'll be inclined to get defensive to avoid being seen as a "bad
          person."
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal with this site is to send a message similar to those, but to
          present the tips as a win-win for both parties, and to cut out the
          accusations and sarcasm. That way, if you link it to someone, they'll
          be more likely to see it for what it is&mdash; a helping hand&mdash;
          as opposed to an insult.
