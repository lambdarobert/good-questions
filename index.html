      <h1>How to get your questions answered faster.</h1>
      <p>
        This is a list of tips on how to get questions answered more quickly in
        online spaces. It's tailored toward technical questions in asynchronous
        media such as emails, chat rooms, and forums.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want an overarching theme to remember, the rule of thumb is to
        <em>give the person answering as little work as possible.</em> Humans
        are lazy creatures&mdash; given the choice between a harder-to-answer
        question and an easier-to-answer question, most people will choose the
        easier question.

      <h2>Be Upfront&mdash; Minimize Back-and-Forth</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">
          Hey, any JavaScript pros around that could help me?
        </div>
        <div class="good">
          I am trying to do X, Y, and Z with JavaScript. Here's what I've tried
          so far and here's why it failed:
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <em>Add as much information as you can to your initial post</em> when
        you ask a question. This will make it easier to answer because the
        answerer won't have to ask as many clarifying questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, when communicating over an asynchronous medium, people
        prefer answering questions on their own time over carving out a specific
        block of time to help someone. As a result, they'll try to avoid
        questions that involve a lot of back-and-forth.
      </p>
      <h3>"No Hello"</h3>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">Hi!</div>
        <div class="good">
          Hi! I ran into this problem with X the other day and needed some help
          with...
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Another tempting mistake is to start with a greeting like "Hi!" or
        "Hello!" This can key people into the fact that someone's online and may
        need help, but if you then spend several minutes writing a longer
        response while others' attention is on you, they might lose interest and
        go back to what they were doing before. On the other hand, if you
        include the problem you want solved in your initial message, they'll see
        it immediately and might help.
      </p>
      <h2>State Your Problem, Not Just Your Solution</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">How do I do X?</div>
        <div class="good">How do I do X? I'm trying to use it to solve Z.</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        This is a restatement of the infamous "XY Problem"&mdash; the case where
        someone is trying to get help using X to solve their problem, when in
        reality the solution to their problem is Y. If you ask about your
        problem (and not just the way you intend to solve it), others can
        provide feedback on possible alternative solutions that could work
        better or be easier to implement, saving you lots of time and effort.
      </p>
      <h2>Ask <em>Where</em> to find Things</h2>
      <div class="comparison">
        <div class="bad">How do I do X?</div>
        <div class="good">Can you send me some articles about how to do X?</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        You'll probably get a faster answer to your questions if you ask about
        <em>where</em> you can find an answer rather than for an answer
        directly&mdash; From an answerer's POV, making a personalized response
        to a question is a lot harder than just sending a link or two.
